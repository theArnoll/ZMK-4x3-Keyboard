# RPi Pico 2 W → RPi Pico W (for test building)

Based on AI generated codes, instructions and file structure
Commited **43** times and built **42** times, ***non*** of them are success

> Decided to change to Seeed XIAO and try to make a minimum unit test on my own,
> and restart from blank template with reading [New Keyboard Shield](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/hardware-integration/new-shield?keyboard-type=unibody&physical-layouts=studio&interconnect=seeed_xiao) by myself and 
       taking AI instructions in the past and from now on as advices.

> Re-cloned [unified-zmk-config-template](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/unified-zmk-config-template/tree/main) to root because following weird error came out,
> and doubted that there are any change or update to the original template.
> Also for ensuring there're no configs that forgot to return to original template,
> make sure everything is restart from blank, and for lazy :P
